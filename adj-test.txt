Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through 1) long/JJ periods of separation, it had the effect of making us 2) tolerant/JJ of each 3) other/JJ's yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the 4) best/JJ of old fellows--had, because of his 5) many/JJ years and 6) many/JJ virtues, the 7) only/JJ cushion on deck, and was lying on the 8) only/JJ rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat 9) cross-legged/JJ 10) right/JJ aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had 11) sunken/JJ cheeks, a 12) yellow/JJ complexion, a straight back, an 13) ascetic/JJ aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had 14) good/JJ hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a 15) few/JJ words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or 16) other/JJ we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt 17) meditative/JJ, and fit for nothing but 18) placid/JJ staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and 19) exquisite/JJ brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a 20) benign/JJ immensity of 21) unstained/JJ light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and 22) radiant/JJ fabric, hung from the 23) wooded/JJ rises inland, and draping the 24) low/JJ shores in 25) diaphanous/JJ folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the 26) upper/JJ reaches, became more 27) sombre/JJ every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

They walked along the 1) grassy/JJ side of the 2) concrete/JJ road that split the panorama right down the 3) middle/JJ all the way down to where it vanished among the hills. It was so 4) old/JJ that Red's father couldn't tell Red when it had been built. It didn't have a crack or a 5) rough/JJ spot in it.  Red said, "Can you keep a secret?"  "Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?"  "Just a secret. Maybe I'll tell you and maybe I won't. I don't know yet." Red broke a 6) long/JJ, 7) supple/JJ stem from a fern they passed, methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a 8) wild/JJ charger, which reared and champed under his iron control. Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for 9) future/JJ use.

The 1) European/JJ insurance sector will soon be faced with the application of Solvency 2 regulation norms. It will create a 2) real/JJ change in risk management practices. The ORSA approach of the 3) second/JJ pillar makes the capital allocation an 4) important/JJ exercise for all insurers and specially for groups. Considering multi-branches firms, capital allocation has to be based on a 5) multivariate/JJ risk modeling. 6) Several/JJ allocation methods are 7) present/JJ in the literature and insurers practices. In this paper, we present a 8) new/JJ risk allocation method, we study its coherence using an 9) axiomatic/JJ approach, and we try to define what the 10) best/JJS allocation choice for an insurance group is. Introduction Solvency 2 standards will make a 11) radical/JJ change in risk management practices in the 12) actuarial/JJ sector. They are based on a strengthening of risk control and minimization of a ruin probability. The determination of the 13) economic/JJ 14) regulatory/JJ capital will be faced under this 15) prudential/JJ mechanism with a kind of 16) methodological/JJ revolution.

Lecturers are 1) non-tenure/JJ track 2) adjunct-faculty/JJ members. They say that they are not treated like professionals, even though they teach classes, engage in writing and research, and hold 3) advanced/JJ degrees from 4) top/JJ universities.

The majority of Lecturers are hired 8) year-by-year/JJ or 9) quarter-by-quarter/JJ as "temp" workers, which leaves them with no job security. Additionally, a 10) full-time/JJ Lecturer's workload is typically twice that of a tenure track professor, yet they are paid significantly less. 11) Many/JJ of the picket signs displayed at the picnic communicated around the theme of precarity. One 12) such/JJ message, "A 13) Precarious/JJ Faculty = A 14) Precarious/JJ University," was emblazoned on a 15) gold/JJ flag along with the stencil of a fist holding a pencil.

A language is a set of 1) valid/JJ sentences. The validity of language can be broken down into two things: syntax and semantics. The term syntax refers to 2) grammatical/JJ structure of a language, rather than what they refer to or mean. Whereas the term semantics is concerned to the meaning of the vocabulary symbols arranged with that structure, often in relation to their truth and falsehood. 3) Grammatical/JJ (syntactically) 4) valid/JJ does not imply 5) sensible/JJ (semantically) 6) valid/JJ. In mathematics, computer science and linguistics, a 7) formal/JJ language is a set of strings of symbols that may be constrained by rules that are 8) specific/JJ to it. In computer science, the process algebras [Baeten, 2004] are mathematically 9) rigorous/JJ languages with well defined semantics that permit describing and verifying properties of 10) concurrent/JJ communicating systems. Process calculi provide a tool for the 11) high-level/JJ description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of 12) independent/JJ agents or processes. They also provide 13) algebraic/JJ laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit 14) formal/JJ reasoning about equivalences between processes.
