1) Heart of Darkness - Joseph Conrad

Between us there was, as I have 1] already/ADV said 2] somewhere/ADV, the bond of the sea. Besides holding 1) our|ADJ hearts 3] together/ADV through 2) long|ADJ periods of separation, it had the effect of making us 3) tolerant|ADJ of each other's yarns--and 4) even|ADJ convictions. The Lawyer--the 5) best|ADJ of 6) old|ADJ fellows--had, because of 7) his|ADJ 8) many|ADJ years and 9) many|ADJ virtues, the 10) only|ADJ cushion on deck, and was lying on the 11) only|ADJ rug. The Accountant had brought 4] out/ADV 5] already/ADV a box of dominoes, and was toying 6] architecturally/ADV with the bones. Marlow sat 7] cross-legged/ADV 12) right|ADJ aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had 13) sunken|ADJ cheeks, a 14) yellow|ADJ complexion, a 15) straight|ADJ back, an 16) ascetic|ADJ aspect, and, with 17) his|ADJ arms dropped, the palms of hands 8] outwards/ADV, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had 18) good|ADJ hold, made 19) his|ADJ way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a 20) few|ADJ words 9] lazily/ADV. 10] Afterwards/ADV there was silence on board the yacht. For 21) some|ADJ reason or 22) other|ADJ we did 11] not/ADV begin that game of dominoes. We felt 23) meditative|ADJ, and fit for nothing but 24) placid|ADJ staring. The day was ending in a serenity of 25) still|ADJ and 26) exquisite|ADJ brilliance. The water shone 12] pacifically/ADV; the sky, without a speck, was a 27) benign|ADJ immensity of 28) unstained|ADJ light; the 29) very|ADJ mist on the Essex marsh was like a 30) gauzy|ADJ and 31) radiant|ADJ fabric, hung from the 32) wooded|ADJ rises inland, and draping the 33) low|ADJ shores in 34) diaphanous|ADJ folds. 35) Only|ADJ the gloom to the west, brooding over the 36) upper|ADJ reaches, became 13] more/ADV 37) sombre|ADJ 38) every|ADJ minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

And at 1] last/ADV , in 38) its|ADJ 39) curved|ADJ and 40) imperceptible|ADJ fall, the sun sank 41) low|ADJ, and from glowing white changed to a 42) dull|ADJ red without rays and without heat, as if about|ADV to go out suddenly|ADV, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.  

Forthwith|ADV a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less|ADV 43) brilliant|ADJ but more|ADV 44) profound|ADJ. The 45) old|ADJ river in 46) its|ADJ 47) broad|ADJ reach rested 48) unruffled|ADJ at the decline of day, after ages of 49) good|ADJ service done to the race that peopled 50) its|ADJ banks, spread out in the 51) tranquil|ADJ dignity of a waterway leading to the 52) uttermost|ADJ ends of the earth. We looked at the 53) venerable|ADJ stream not|ADV in the 54) vivid|ADJ flush of a 55) short|ADJ day that comes and departs for ever|ADV, but in the 56) august|ADJ light of abiding memories. And indeed|ADV nothing is 57) easier|ADJ for a man who has, as the phrase goes, " followed the sea " with reverence and affection, than to evoke the 58) great|ADJ spirit of the past upon the 59) lower|ADJ reaches of the Thames. The 60) tidal|ADJ current runs to and fro in 61) its|ADJ 62) unceasing|ADJ service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea.

It had borne 65) all|ADJ the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with 66) her|ADJ 67) rotund|ADJ flanks 68) full|ADJ of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus|ADV pass out of the 69) gigantic|ADJ tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on 70) other|ADJ conquests—and that never|ADV returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith—the adventurers and the settlers; kings' ships and the ships of men on' Change; captains, admirals, the dark" interlopers" of the 71) Eastern|ADJ trade, and the commissioned" generals" of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the 72) sacred|ADJ fire. What greatness had not|ADV floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an 73) unknown|ADJ earth!... The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

 And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, "followed the sea" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea.

2) Youth - Isaac Asimov

The swaying had come to a halt and it was 1) dark|ADJ. The Explorer was not 2) comfortable|ADJ in the alien air. It felt as 3) thick|ADJ as soup and he had to breathe 4) shallowly|ADJ. Even so—

He reached out in a sudden need for company. The Merchant was warm to the touch. His breathing was rough, he moved in an occasional spasm, and was obviously asleep. The Explorer hesitated and decided not to wake him. It would serve no real purpose.

There would be no rescue, of course. That was the penalty paid for the high profits which unrestrained competition could lead to. The Merchant who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade, which he might hug to himself or, more likely, rent out to all comers at a stiff price. It followed that planets were searched for in secrecy and, preferably, away from the usual trade routes. In a case such as theirs, then, there was little or no chance that another ship would come within range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of coincidences. Even if they were in their ship, that is, rather than in this—this—cage.

The Explorer grasped the thick bars. Even if they blasted those away, as they could, they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping.

It was too bad. They had landed twice before in the scout-ship. They had established contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge, but mild and unaggressive. It was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing technology, but hadn't faced up to the consequences of such a technology. It would have been a wonderful market.

And it was a tremendous world. The Merchant, especially, had been taken aback. He had known the figures that expressed the planet's diameter, but from a distance of two light-seconds, he had stood at the visi-plate and muttered, "Unbelievable!"

"Oh, there are larger worlds," the Explorer said. It wouldn't do for an Explorer to be too easily impressed.

"Inhabited?"

"Well, no."

"Why, you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it."

The Explorer smiled. It was a gentle dig at his Arcturian homeland, which was smaller than most planets. He said, "Not quite."

The Merchant followed along the line of his thoughts. "And the inhabitants are large in proportion to their world?" He sounded as though the news struck him less favorably now.

3) A risk management approach to capital allocation - V. Maume-Deschamps, D. Rulliére, and K. Said

Solvency 2 standards will make a radical change in risk management practices in the actuarial sector. They are based on a strengthening of risk control and minimization of a ruin probability. The determination of the economic regulatory capital will be faced under this prudential mechanism with a kind of methodological revolution. A choices of a dependence model between different risks and of an aggregation methodology are both required. In the prescribed Standard Formula, risks aggregation is done using correlation matrices that connect families and subfamilies of risks. Once the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is calculated, its allocation between the different risky activity branches becomes the new operational challenge.

Capital allocation is an internal exercise, certainly not controlled by the first pillar of Solvency 2, but it plays a crucial role in determining performance of all the insurer activity. The case of insurance groups requires special treatment in the context of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) approach. In this context, a multivariate analysis of risk seems relevant. 

The issue of capital allocation in a multivariate context arises from the presence of dependence between the various risky activities which may generate a diversification effect. Several allocation methods in the literature are based on a choice of a univariate risk measure and an allocation principle. Others are based on optimizing a multivariate ruin probability or some multivariate risk indicators. In this paper, we focus on the allocation technique by minimizing some risk indicators.

The literature on the subject of capital allocation methods is very rich. Several principles have been proposed over the last twenty years. The most important and most studied are the Shapley method, the Aumann-Shapley method and the Euler’s method. 
The Shapley method is based on cooperative game theory. It is described in detail in Denault’s paper (2001) [10].  Denault proved that this method, originally used to allocate the total cost between players in coalitional games context, can be easily adapted to solve the problem of the overall risk allocation between segments.

Tasche devoted two papers [21] and [22] to describe Euler’s method. Euler’s method is also found in the literature under the name of gradient method. It is based on the idea of allocating capital according to the infinitesimal marginal impact of each risk. This impact corresponds to the increase obtained on the overall risk, yielding an infinitely small increment in a marginal risk. Euler’s method is very present in the literature. Several papers analyze its properties (RORAC compatibility [6], [23], Coherence [5],...) under different assumptions (Tasche (2004) [20], Balog (2011) [2]). Its fame is due to the existence of economic arguments that can justify its use to develop allocation rules.
Finally, Aumann-Shapley method is a continuous generalization of Shapley method. Its principle is based on the value introduced by Aumann and Shaplay in game theory. Denault [10] analyzes this method and its application to capital allocation.

These three capital allocation principles rely on different risk measures. The coherence of the allocation method depends on the properties of the selected risk measure.  Several papers deal with capital allocation coherence based on the properties of the risk measure used. We quote as examples, Fischer (2003) [12], Bush and Dorfleitner (2008) [5], and Kalkbrener (2009) [16].

4) UC Santa Cruz Lecturers Mark Expiration of Contract with "St. Precaria's Picnic" - Alex Darocy @ alexdarocy.com

Lecturers are non-tenure track adjunct-faculty members. They say that they are not treated like professionals, even though they teach classes, engage in writing and research, and hold advanced degrees from top universities. Across the University of California system about one-third of all classes are taught by Lecturers, and contingent faculty members teach over half of the UC's undergraduate credit hours in total, if graduate student teachers are included in the equation.

The majority of Lecturers are hired year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter as "temp" workers, which leaves them with no job security. Additionally, a full-time Lecturer's workload is typically twice that of a tenure track professor, yet they are paid significantly less.

Many of the picket signs displayed at the picnic communicated around the theme of precarity. One such message, "A Precarious Faculty = A Precarious University," was emblazoned on a gold flag along with the stencil of a fist holding a pencil.

Precarity has been defined as a condition of instability in the workforce created in postindustrial societies when management seeks to increase its own strength by limiting job opportunities to temporary and or part-time work.

In February, organizers of the National Adjunct Day of Action adopted "Saint Precaria" as their "icon saint" and individuals at UC Santa Cruz continue to develop themes surrounding precarity.

"All these movements that we are building together are really interconnected, all the student movements and the union movements that we have been working on for many years together," explained Josh Brahinsky at a mid-day rally held at the picnic. Brahinsky teaches courses at both UC Santa Cruz and San Jose State University.

"We're all facing a certain kind of neo-liberal budget where they play with it, and mess with the money," he said. "They don't spend the money on undergraduate education, which is what we are all here to make happen."

Brahinsky said that the University of California has, "made a priority out of administrative spending," noting that it has increased by over 250% in the last 20 years. The growth of faculty spending over the same time period has only increased by 50%, he said, adding that 20 years ago there were five faculty members for every two administrators, but the figure has shifted dramatically, and presently there are only five faculty members for every six administrators, on average.

5) Logical Inference by DNA Strand Algebra - Kumar S. Ray, Mandrita Mondal

Conventional silicon based computing has been successful over the past several decades. It is fast, flexible, and well understood. But it has reached its limitations of design  complexity, processing power, memory, energy consumption, density and heat dissipation. Alternatives to these traditional methods of building computers have been proposed and in recent past molecular computing has gained considerable attention for  non-silicon based computing which can overcome conventional computation problems. The Watson-Crick base pairing makes DNA a powerful tool for engineering at nano-scale [Adleman, 1994; Benenson et al., 2001; Green et al., 2006; Winfree et al.,  1998]. The behaviour of DNA molecules can be predicted, and by setting up strands of DNA in the right way, they can draw conclusion from a set of logical inference rules [Ray and Mondal, 2011a; Ray and Mondal, 2011b].

In this paper we have performed logical reasoning by modus ponens using DNA  strand algebra, which can be defined as a branch of process algebra. The operations of DNA strands in present model are based on the mechanism of DNA strand displacement. Process algebras are widely used for defining the formal semantics of concurrent communicating processes. Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes. They also provide algebraic laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit  formal reasoning about equivalences between processes. The main components of DNA strand algebra are DNA strands, DNA gates, and their interactions.

Before going in detail description of DNA strand algebra we first have to know  what is syntax and semantics. How are they different? [Cardelli, 2009; Cardelli 2013] 

A language is a set of valid sentences. The validity of language can be broken down into two things: syntax and semantics. The term syntax refers to grammatical structure of a language, rather than what they refer to or mean. Whereas the term semantics is concerned to the meaning of the vocabulary symbols arranged with that structure, often in relation to their truth and falsehood. Grammatical (syntactically) valid does not imply sensible (semantically) valid. In mathematics, computer science and linguistics, a formal language is a set of strings of symbols that may be constrained by rules that are specific to it.

In computer science, the process algebras [Baeten, 2004] are mathematically rigorous languages with well defined semantics that permit describing and verifying properties of concurrent communicating systems. Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes.

In computer science , the process algebras [ Baeten , 2004 ] are mathematically|ADV rigorous|ADJ languages with well|ADV defined semantics that permit describing and verifying properties of concurrent|ADJ communicating systems. Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level|ADJ description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent|ADJ agents or processes. They also|ADV provide algebraic|ADJ laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit formal|ADJ reasoning about equivalences between processes.
