5) Neutron Star - Wikipedia

In 1965, 1) Antony Hewish/PERSON and 2) Samuel Okoye/PERSON discovered "an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the 3) Crab Nebula/LOCATION“.[26] This source turned out to be the 4) Crab Pulsar/LOCATION that resulted from the great supernova of 1054.

In 1967, 5) Iosif Shklovsky/PERSON examined the X-ray and optical observations of 6) Scorpius X-1/LOCATION and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star at the stage of accretion.[27]

In 1967, 7) Jocelyn Bell/PERSON and 8) Antony Hewish/PERSON discovered regular radio pulses from CP 1919. This pulsar was later interpreted as an isolated, rotating neutron star. The energy source of the pulsar is the rotational energy of the neutron star. The majority of known neutron stars (about 2000, as of 2010) have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses.

In 1971, 9) Riccardo Giacconi/PERSON, 10) Herbert Gursky/PERSON, 11) Ed Kellogg/PERSON, 12) R. Levinson/PERSON, 13) E. Schreier/PERSON, and 14) H. Tananbaum/PERSON discovered 4.8 second pulsations in an X-ray source in the constellation 15) Centaurus/LOCATION, 16) Cen X-3/LOCATION. They interpreted this as resulting from a rotating hot neutron star. The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of the neutron star from a companion star or the interstellar medium.

In 1974, 17) Antony Hewish/PERSON was awarded the 18) Nobel Prize/MISC in Physics "for his decisive role in the discovery of pulsars" without 19) Jocelyn Bell/PERSON who shared in the discovery.

In 1974, 20) Joseph Taylor/PERSON and 21) Russell Hulse/PERSON discovered the first binary pulsar, 22) PSR B1913+16/MISC, which consists of two neutron stars (one seen as a pulsar) orbiting around their center of mass. 23) Einstein/PERSON’s general theory of relativity predicts that massive objects in short binary orbits should emit gravitational waves, and thus that their orbit should decay with time. This was indeed observed, precisely as general relativity predicts, and in 1993, 24) Taylor/PERSON and 25) Hulse/PERSON were awarded the 26) Nobel Prize in Physics/MISC for this discovery.

In 1982, 27) Don Backer/PERSON and colleagues discovered the first millisecond pulsar, 28) PSR B1937+21/MISC. This objects spins 642 times per second, a value that placed fundamental constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars. Many millisecond pulsars were later discovered, but 29) PSR B1937+21/MISC remained the fastest-spinning known pulsar for 24 years, until 30) PSR J1748-2446ad/MISC (which spins more than 700 times a second) was discovered.

In 2003, 31) Marta Burgay/PERSON and colleagues discovered the first double neutron star system where both components are detectable as pulsars, 32) PSR J0737-3039/MISC. The discovery of this system allows a total of 5 different tests of general relativity, some of these with unprecedented precision.

In 2010, 33) Paul Demorest/PERSON and colleagues measured the mass of the millisecond pulsar 34) PSR J1614–2230/MISC to be 1.97±0.04 M☉, using 35) Shapiro delay/MISC.[28] This was substantially higher than any previously measured neutron star mass (1.67 M, see 36) PSR J1903+0327/MISC), and places strong constraints on the interior composition of neutron stars.

In 2013, 37) John Antoniadis/PERSON and colleagues measured the mass of 38) PSR J0348+0432/MISC to be 2.01±0.04 M, using white dwarf spectroscopy.[29] This confirmed the existence of such massive stars using a different method. Furthermore, this allowed, for the first time, a test of general relativity using such a massive neutron star.

6) Dry-Farming : A System of Agriculture for Countries under a Low Rainfall by Widtsoe

_"The 1) Pacific Type/ORGANIZATION.—_This type is found in all of the territory west of the 2) Cascade/LOCATION and 3) Sierra Nevada/LOCATION ranges, and also obtains in a fringe of country to the eastward of the mountain summits. The distinguishing characteristic of the 4) Pacific/LOCATION type is a wet season, extending from 5) October/DATE to 6) March/DATE, and a practically rainless summer, except in northern 7) California/LOCATION and parts of 8) Oregon/LOCATION and 9) Washington/LOCATION. About half of the yearly precipitation comes in the months of 10) December/DATE, 11) January/DATE, and 12) February/DATE, the remaining half being distributed throughout the seven months— 13) September/DATE, 14) October/DATE, 15) November/DATE, 16) March/DATE, 17) April/DATE, 18) May/DATE, and 19) June/DATE.”

_” 20) Sub-Pacific Type/ORGANIZATION.—_The term ’ 21) Sub-Pacific/MISC’ has been given to that type of rainfall which obtains over eastern 22) Washington/LOCATION, 23) Nevada/LOCATION, and 24) Utah/LOCATION. The influences that control the precipitation of this region are much similar to those that prevail west of the 25) Sierra Nevada/LOCATION and 26) Cascade/LOCATION ranges. There is not, however, as in the eastern type, a steady diminution in the precipitation with the approach of spring, but rather a culmination in the precipitation."

_” 27) Arizona Type/ORGANIZATION.—_The 28) Arizona Type/ORGANIZATION, so called because it is more fully developed in that territory than elsewhere, prevails over 29) Arizona/LOCATION, 30) New Mexico/LOCATION, and a small portion of eastern 31) Utah/LOCATION and 32) Nevada/LOCATION. This type differs from all others in the fact that about 35 per cent of the rain falls in 33) July/DATE and 34) August/DATE. 35) May/DATE and 36) June/DATE are generally the months of least rainfall."

_"The 37) Northern Rocky Mountain and Eastern Foothills Type/ORGANIZATION.—_This type is closely allied to that of the plains to the eastward, and the bulk of the rain falls in the foothills of the region in 38) April/DATE and 39) May/DATE; in 40) Montana/LOCATION, in 41) May/DATE and 42) June/DATE.”

_"The 43) Plains Type/ORGANIZATION.—_This type embraces the greater part of the 44) Dakotas, 45) Nebraska/LOCATION, 46) Kansas/LOCATION; 47) Oklahoma/LOCATION, the 48) Panhandle of Texas/LOCATION, and all the great corn and wheat states of the interior valleys. This region is characterized by a scant winter precipitation over the northern states and moderately heavy rains during the growing season. The. bulk of the rains comes in 48) May/DATE, 49) June/DATE, and 50) July/DATE.”

This classification emphasizes the great variation in distribution of rainfall over the dry-farm territory of the country. West of the 51) Rocky Mountains/LOCATION the precipitation comes chiefly in winter and spring, leaving the summers rainless; while east of the 52) Rockies/LOCATION, the winters are somewhat rainless and the precipitation comes chiefly in spring and summer. The 53) Arizona type/ORGANIZATION stands midway between these types. This variation in the distribution of the rainfall requires that different methods be employed in storing and conserving the rainfall for crop production. The adaptation of cultural methods to the seasonal distribution of rainfall will be discussed hereafter.

7) Morphology and histology of the alimentary tract of adult palm weevil, Rhynchophorus phoenicis Fabricius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) - Omotoso Olumuyiwa Temitope

Palm weevil (Rhynchophorus phoenicis)is a notorious pest of oil palm trees, worldwide. Investigations were conducted on the alimentary tract of the adult insect. Results of the morphology and histology of the alimentary tract revealed that the alimentary tract consisted of a foregut, which was made up of a buccal cavity, oesophagus, crop and proventriculus. The crop big or small and the proventriculus had bristle  teeth  which the  insect  used  in  the  mechanical  breakdown  of  ingested  food.  The  midgut  is  the longest part of the alimentary tract and most prominent features there are goblet cells, columnar cells, villi, microvilli and intestinal glands. The midgut was well adapted for the digestion and assimilation of food.  The  hindgut  was  responsible  for  the  re-absorption  of  water  from  undigested  food  (feaces) because of the presence of rectal pads. The results of these investigations revealed that the alimentary tract  of  the weevil  was  structurally  and  functionally  adapted  to  digest  and  extract  its nutritional requirements from its food. 

In Gel Digestion. Protein spots were excised from the gel and  in  gel  digested  with  trypsin  according  to  published  procedures as  modified  by  us. A  “control”  piece of  gel  was  cut from a blank region of the gel and processed in parallel with the sample. In  contrast  to  the  protocol  described  for  Coomassie-stained gels, all prewashing steps were omitted. After the gel pieces  were  excised  and  shrunk  by  dehydration  in  acetonitrile, which was then removed, they were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. A  volume  of  10  mM  dithiotreitol  (DTT)  in  100  mM  NH 4 HCO 3 sufficient to cover the gel pieces was added, and the proteins were reduced for 1 h at 56°C. After cooling to room temperature, the DTT solution was replaced with roughly the same volume of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3.  After 45 min incubation at ambient temperature in the dark with occasional vortexing, the gel pieces were washed with 50 - 100 Ì

8) King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table - Sir Thomas Malory

The story of 1) Merlin/PERSON, that man of magic, is the least important of the four branches, though 2) Merlin/PERSON is still an intensely interesting figure in the story of 3) Arthur/PERSON that we read to-day. The story of 4) Lancelot/PERSON was to prove very important; starting as a romance that had very little connection with 5) Arthur/PERSON, it became with 6) Malory/PERSON and 7) Tennyson/PERSON the real center of interest of the plot. The story of the 8) Holy Grail/MISC proved almost equally important. In the earliest accounts of this 9) Perceval/PERSON was the knight chosen above all others to reach the 10) Grail Castle/LOCATION, but 11) Perceval/PERSON was too rough and worldly a knight to suit the taste of the monks who wrote out the legends and so they created 12) Galahad/PERSON to take his place as their own ideal of perfection. And into these adventures are woven some of the tales of Sir 13) Gawain/PERSON, among them the delightful story of 14) Gawain/PERSON and the 15) Little Maid/PERSON with the 16) Narrow Sleeves/MISC. To the legend of 17) Perceval/PERSON, 18) Wolfram von Eschenbach/PERSON, a 19) Bavarian/MISC, added the story of the son of 20) Perceval/PERSON, or 21) Parzival/PERSON, as he calls him, the story of 22) Lohengrin/PERSON, the famous 23) Swan-knight/PERSON. 24) Tristram/PERSON and 25) Iseult/PERSON, the fourth of the branches, though less connected with 26) Arthur/PESON than either 27) Lancelot/PERSON or the 28) Holy Grail/MISC, became immensely popular with poets and remancers because of its great love story, and is to be found told again and again in widely varying forms all through the 29) Middle Ages/MISC.

So we have seen that a 30) British/MISC chieftain, winning a great battle in the year 31) 500/DATE, became in time celebrated throughout 32) Europe/LOCATION as the greatest king of romance. So far it was mainly the 33) French/MISC who had made him famous. 34) Layamon/PERSON, an 35) English/MISC priest, had written a poem in 36) English/MISC concerning 37) Arthur/PERSON shortly after 38) 1200/DATE, and told of the founding of the 39) Round Table/ORGANIZATION, but it was to be a considerable time yet before any 40) English/MISC writer was to attempt what the 41) French/MISC had already done. 42) Chaucer/PERSON told none of the 43) Arthurian/MISC stories, though he placed the scene of his 44) Wife of Bath's Tale/MISC at 45) King Arthur/PERSON’s court. An unknown 46) English/MISC poet wrote Sir 47) Gawaine/PERSON and the 48) Green Knight/PERSON somewhere between 49) 1350/DATE and 50) 1375/DATE. It is not until we come to the 51) Morte Darthur/PERSON of Sir 52) Thomas Malory/PERSON, finished in 53) 1469/DATE or 54) 1470/DATE, that we reach the next great step in the history of the legends since the time of 55) Chrétien de Troies/PERSON. But in 56) Malory/PERSON’s story 57) Arthur/PERSON steps forth resplendent, the kingly figure that we have to-day.

Little is known concerning Sir 58) Thomas Malory/PERSON. He seems to have been a knight and country gentleman of 59) Warwickshire/LOCATION, a member of 60) Parliament/ORGANIZATION in the reign of 61) Henry VI/PERSON, and later a soldier on the side of 62) Lancaster/LOCATION in the 63) Wars of the Roses/MISC. As a result of the victory of the party of 64) York/ORGANIZATION he had to retire from public life when 65) Edward IV/PERSON came to the throne, and lived quietly at his 66) Warwickshire/LOCATION estate. He was familiar with life at court and with men-at-arms and he knew how popular the stories of 67) King Arthur/PERSON were becoming in 68) England/LOCATION. So, being a man of education, he set to work to make a collection of the legends, using as his chief sources the 69) French/MISC romances.

The story of Merlin, that man of magic, is the least important of the four branches, though Merlin is still an intensely interesting figure in the story of Arthur that we read to-day. The story of Lancelot was to prove very important; starting as a romance that had very little connection with Arthur, it became with Malory and Tennyson the real center of interest of the plot. The story of the Holy Grail proved almost equally important. In the earliest accounts of this Perceval was the knight chosen above all others to reach the Grail Castle, but Perceval was too rough and worldly a knight to suit the taste of the monks who wrote out the legends and so they created Galahad to take his place as their own ideal of perfection. And into these adventures are woven some of the tales of Sir Gawain, among them the delightful story of Gawain and the Little Maid with the Narrow Sleeves. To the legend of Perceval, Wolfram von Eschenbach, a Bavarian, added the story of the son of Perceval, or Parzival, as he calls him, the story of Lohengrin, the famous Swan-knight. Tristram and Iseult, the fourth of the branches, though less connected with Arthur than either Lancelot or the Holy Grail, became immensely popular with poets and remancers because of its great love story, and is to be found told again and again in widely varying forms all through the Middle Ages.

So we have seen that a British chieftain, winning a great battle in the year 500, became in time celebrated throughout Europe as the greatest king of romance. So far it was mainly the French who had made him famous. Layamon, an English priest, had written a poem in English concerning Arthur shortly after 1200, and told of the founding of the Round Table, but it was to be a considerable time yet before any English writer was to attempt what the French had already done. Chaucer told none of the Arthurian stories, though he placed the scene of his Wife of Bath's Tale at King Arthur’s court. An unknown English poet wrote Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight somewhere between 1350 and 1375. It is not until we come to the Morte Darthur of Sir Thomas Malory, finished in 1469 or 1470, that we reach the next great step in the history of the legends since the time of Chrétien de Troies. But in Malory’s story Arthur steps forth resplendent, the kingly figure that we have to-day.
