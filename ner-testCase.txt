Carl Krawitt/PERSON has watched his son, Rhett/PERSON, now 6, fight leukemia for the past 4 1/2 years. For more than three of those years, Rhett/PERSON has undergone round after round of chemotherapy. Last year he finished chemotherapy, and doctors say he is in remission.
Now, there's a new threat, one that the family should not have to worry about: measles./Rhett/PERSON cannot be vaccinated, because his immune system is still rebuilding. It may be months more before his body is healthy enough to get all his immunizations. Until then, he depends on everyone around him for protection — what's known as herd immunity.
But /Rhett/PERSON lives in /Marin County/LOCATION, /Calif./LOCATION, a county with the dubious honor of having the highest rate of "personal belief exemptions" in the /Bay Area/LOCATION and among the highest in the state. This school year, 6.45 percent of children in /Marin/LOCATION have a personal belief exemption, which allows parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated against communicable diseases like measles, polio, whooping cough and more.

2) Trans Pacific Partnership trade bill -  NewsArticle8

The /TPP/ORGANIZATION would create an environment hostile to journalists and whistleblowers, said policy directors for the /Electronic Frontier Foundation/ORGANIZATION and /Fight for the Future/ORGANIZATION, co-authors of the letter. “/TPP/ORGANIZATION’s trade secrets provisions could make it a crime for people to reveal corporate wrongdoing ‘through a computer system’,” says the letter. “The language is dangerously vague, and enables signatory countries to enact rules that would ban reporting on timely, critical issues affecting the public.”

Among the signatories are activist, sci-fi author and /Guardian/ORGANIZATION tech columnist /Cory Doctorow/PERSON. “/Democracies/MISC make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms,” /Doctorow/PERSON wrote. “If /TPP/ORGANIZATION’s backers truly believed that they were doing the people’s work, they’d have invited the people into the room. The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on – even going so far as to threaten /Congress/ORGANIZATION with jail if they spoke about it – tells you that this is something being done *to* /Americans/MISC, not *for* /Americans/MISC.”

/Brazil/LOCATION, officially the /Federative Republic of Brazil/LOCATION, is the largest country in both /South America/LOCATION and the /Latin American/MISC region.

Bounded by the /Atlantic Ocean/LOCATION on the east, /Brazil/LOCATION has a coastline of 7,491 km. It borders all other /South American/MISC countries except /Ecuador/LOCATION and /Chile/LOCATION and occupies 47.3 percent of the continent of /South America/LOCATION. Its /Amazon River/LOCATION basin includes a vast tropical forest and is the scene of debates over deforestation. /Brazil/LOCATION was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing of explorer /Pedro Álvares Cabral/PERSON in 1500, who claimed the area for /Portugal/LOCATION. /Brazil/LOCATION remained a /Portuguese/MISC colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was transferred from /Lisbon/LOCATION to /Rio de Janeiro/LOCATION after /French/MISC forces invaded /Portugal/LOCATION. In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the /United Kingdom of Portugal/LOCATION, /Brazil/LOCATION and the /Algarves/LOCATION.

/Tlaltecuhtli/PERSON is a pre-/Columbian Mesoamerican/MISC deity figure, identified from sculpture and iconography dating to the /Late Postclassic/MISC period of /Mesoamerican/MISC chronology, primarily among the /Mexica/ORGANIZATION and other /Nahuatl/MISC-speaking cultures. /Tlaltecuhtli/PERSON is also known from several post-conquest manuscripts that surveyed /Mexica/ORGANIZATION mythology and belief systems, such as the /Histoyre du méchique/MISC compiled in the mid-16th century.

In one of the /Mexica/PERSON creation accounts /Tlaltecuhtli/PERSON is described as a sea monster who dwelled in the ocean after the fourth /Great Flood/MISC, an embodiment of the raging chaos before creation. /Quetzalcoatl/PERSON and /Tezcatlipoca/PERSON, in the form of serpents, tore him in half, throwing half upwards to create the sky and stars and leaving the other half to become the land of the earth.

5) Neutron Star - Wikipedia

In 1965, /Antony Hewish/PERSON and /Samuel Okoye/PERSON discovered "an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the /Crab Nebula/LOCATION“.[26] This source turned out to be the /Crab Pulsar/LOCATION that resulted from the great supernova of 1054.

In 1967, /Iosif Shklovsky/PERSON examined the X-ray and optical observations of /Scorpius X-1/LOCATION and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star at the stage of accretion.[27]

In 1967, /Jocelyn Bell/PERSON and /Antony Hewish/PERSON discovered regular radio pulses from CP 1919. This pulsar was later interpreted as an isolated, rotating neutron star. The energy source of the pulsar is the rotational energy of the neutron star. The majority of known neutron stars (about 2000, as of 2010) have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses.

In 1971, /Riccardo Giacconi/PERSON, /Herbert Gursky/PERSON, /Ed Kellogg/PERSON, /R. Levinson/PERSON, /E. Schreier/PERSON, and /H. Tananbaum/PERSON discovered 4.8 second pulsations in an X-ray source in the constellation /Centaurus/LOCATION, /Cen X-3/LOCATION. They interpreted this as resulting from a rotating hot neutron star. The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of the neutron star from a companion star or the interstellar medium.

In 1974, /Antony Hewish/PERSON was awarded the /Nobel Prize/MISC in Physics "for his decisive role in the discovery of pulsars" without /Jocelyn Bell/PERSON who shared in the discovery.

In 1974, /Joseph Taylor/PERSON and /Russell Hulse/PERSON discovered the first binary pulsar, /PSR B1913+16/MISC, which consists of two neutron stars (one seen as a pulsar) orbiting around their center of mass. /Einstein/PERSON’s general theory of relativity predicts that massive objects in short binary orbits should emit gravitational waves, and thus that their orbit should decay with time. This was indeed observed, precisely as general relativity predicts, and in 1993, /Taylor/PERSON and /Hulse/PERSON were awarded the /Nobel Prize in Physics/MISC for this discovery.

In 1982, /Don Backer/PERSON and colleagues discovered the first millisecond pulsar, /PSR B1937+21/MISC. This objects spins 642 times per second, a value that placed fundamental constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars. Many millisecond pulsars were later discovered, but /PSR B1937+21/MISC remained the fastest-spinning known pulsar for 24 years, until /PSR J1748-2446ad/MISC (which spins more than 700 times a second) was discovered.

In 2003, /Marta Burgay/PERSON and colleagues discovered the first double neutron star system where both components are detectable as pulsars, /PSR J0737-3039/MISC. The discovery of this system allows a total of 5 different tests of general relativity, some of these with unprecedented precision.

In 2010, /Paul Demorest/PERSON and colleagues measured the mass of the millisecond pulsar /PSR J1614–2230/MISC to be 1.97±0.04 M☉, using /Shapiro delay/MISC.[28] This was substantially higher than any previously measured neutron star mass (1.67 M, see /PSR J1903+0327/MISC), and places strong constraints on the interior composition of neutron stars.

In 2013, /John Antoniadis/PERSON and colleagues measured the mass of /PSR J0348+0432/MISC to be 2.01±0.04 M, using white dwarf spectroscopy.[29] This confirmed the existence of such massive stars using a different method. Furthermore, this allowed, for the first time, a test of general relativity using such a massive neutron star.
