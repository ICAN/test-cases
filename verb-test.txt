1// War and Peace Book 1 - Leo Tolstoy

"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news."  It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.  All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:  "If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette Scherer."  "Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

2// World welcomes 100th mammoth skyscraper - CNN http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/architecture/supertall-skyscrapers-100-432-park-avenue-new-york/index.html?eref=rss_topstories

 (CNN)It started in Manhattan, 1930: the Chrysler Building, nudging over 300 meters (984 feet), became the world's first supertall skyscraper. A new benchmark for aerial architecture had been set, and over the course of the next 80 years, 49 more were added to the list.

Now, remarkably, that number has doubled. Between 2010 and 2015, 50 new supertall skyscrapers were built, and the hundredth is now open for business.

At 425.5 meters (1396 feet) high, 432 Park Avenue in New York City is only the fourteenth highest building in the world, but its symbolism cannot be overstated. It marks a significant juncture in an astonishing period of rapid architectural growth, coinciding with economic booms in both the Middle East and Asia.

The slender skyscraper is typical of "skinny" new construction projects being built in high density areas, and becomes the seventh building over 300 meters (984 feet) in New York. Designed by Rafael Vinoly and developed by CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, 432 Park Avenue is the tallest all-residential building in the world. 104 luxury condominiums are priced from $7 million, with the penthouse retailing at $95 million -- more than double the construction cost of the Empire State Building in 1931.

The world's hundredth supertall building may have been constructed in New York, but since the turn of the century the focus of skyscraper construction has shifted east.

Today, 22 buildings in the United Arab Emirates stand at over 300 meters (984 feet), and China is host to 36. One of those in the Emirates was constructed before 2000, and only six were finished in China pre-Millennium. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia now owns the third highest building in the world, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower.

The 828 meter-high (2717 feet) Burj Khalifa in Dubai has held the record for the world's tallest building since 2010, and currently stands 198 meters (650 feet) above the Shanghai Tower, its nearest rival. That's set to change however, when the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia completes in 2018, becoming the first man-made structure to surpass one kilometer (0.6 miles) in height.

Three other projects currently under construction, the Suzhou Zhongnan Center and Wuhan Greenland Center, both in China, and KL118 Tower, in Malaysia, also surpass 600 meters (1969 feet) -- and so qualify as "megatall" buildings, the latest standard for extreme skyscrapers.

Height isn't everything however, and only time will tell if these new creations become design classics. Scroll through the gallery below to see which gravity-defying structures have taken on an iconic status.

3// The Origin of the Red Cross - Henri Dunant

The lot of the Austrian prisoners-of-war[23] is very sad. Led like simple cattle, they are sent in a crowd, with a strong guard, to Brescia, where they at last find repose, if not a kind welcome.

Some French soldiers wish to do violence to the Hungarian captives whom they take for Croates, adding furiously that those "Glued-pantalooners," as they called them, always killed the wounded. I succeeded in tearing from their hands these unfortunate, trembling captives.

On the battle-field many Austrians are permitted to keep their swords. They have the same food as the French officers. Some troops of the allied army fraternally divide their biscuits with the famished prisoners. Some even take the wounded on their backs and carry them to the ambulances. Near me the lieutenant of the guard bandages with his white handkerchief the head of a Tyrolese which was scarcely covered with old, torn, and dirty linen.

During the previous day at the height of the battle, Commandant de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, the fearless African hunter, threw himself upon a squad of Hungarians; but his horse having been pierced through with balls, he himself was struck by two shots and made prisoner by the Hungarians.[24] Learning that wounded La Rochefoucauld had been captured by the soldiers, the Austrian Emperor ordered that he be treated with great kindness and given the best care.

The commissary continue to pick up the wounded. These, bandaged or not, are carried by mules or wheelbarrows and litters to the field hospitals in the villages and towns near the place where they fell.

In these towns, churches, monasteries, houses, parks, courts, streets and promenades are transformed into improvised hospitals.

In Carpenedolo, Castel-Goffredo, Medole, Guidizzolo, Volta and neighboring places are arriving many of the wounded. But the greater number are carried to Castiglione, where the least mutilated have already succeeded in dragging themselves.

Behold the long procession of vehicles of the Commissary Department, loaded with soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers of all grades mixed together; cavalry-men, infantry, artillerymen, bleeding, fatigued, lacerated, covered with dust. Each jolt of the wagons which carry them imposing on them new suffering.

Then the mules come trotting in, their gait drawing, each instant, bitter cries from[25] the throats of the unfortunate wounded whom they are bearing.

Many die during the transportation.

4// Nutrient-Regulated Phosphorylation of ATG13 Inhibits Starvation-Induced Autophagy - Cindy Puente, Ronald C. Hendrickson, Xuejun Jiang

In  cultured  mouse  embryonic  fibroblasts (MEFs), amino acid starvation or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR resulted in the appearance of a fast-migrating form of ATG13 assayed by western blot (Figure 1a). Treatment of the cell lysates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) yielded faster migrating bands, indicating that the gel-shifts are due to altered phosphorylation. This result suggests that ATG13 is phosphorylated when cells are cultured under nutrient-rich condition, likely in an mTOR-dependent manner, and is dephosphorylated upon starvation. In order to identify these nutrient-regulated phosphorylation sites, we conducted tandem affinity tag immunoprecipitation and nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS). We generated a MEF cell line stably expressing ATG13 with an N-terminal FLAG and S-tag (F/S-ATG13). We expressed F/S-ATG13 to near endogenous levels. This ectopically expressed F/S-ATG13 retained the ability to undergo a starvation-induced electrophoretic mobility shift (Figure 1b). We purified F/S-ATG13 from cells under nutrient-rich media or upon amino acid/serum starvation. The MS analysis covered nearly 80% of the ATG13 protein sequence. Under nutrient rich conditions, multiple distinct phosphorylated sites were identified, including Ser224 and Ser258 (Figure 1c-d). We further found that Ser224 and Ser258 sites are dephosphorylated upon starvation; we compared the integrated selected ion current chromatogram (monoisotopic mass +/- 5 ppm) of phosphorylated peptide versus the integrated selected ion current chromatogram (monoisotopic mass +/- 5 ppm) of the nonphosphorylated peptide under full media or starvation media (an internal ATG13 peptide was used to normalize the integrated peak areas across the different conditions). In doing so, we detected a 56% reduction in phosphorylated Ser224 and a 93% reduction in phosphorylated Ser258, under starvation conditions (Figure 1e).

5// James B. Longacre - Wikipedia

James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania on August 11, 1794. His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendent of early Swedish settlers of North America.[1] When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.[2]

Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.[3] This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $139,128 today).[2] Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht.[4] Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.[2]

6// Paths of Possession - Wikipedia

Formed in 1999 by Randy Butman (Silhaven), Jay Fossen, Erin "Goat" Fuller (Cryptic Winds) and Richard Brunelle (ex-Morbid Angel guitarist), as Swollen, Paths of Possession is a solid mix of traditional heavy metal with influences of Swedish melodic death metal. Paths of Possession independently released their first CD-r demo, Legacy in Ashes, in 2000.

Following the release of Legacy of Ashes, Erin left the band to join Hell on Earth and was replaced by Brian Ridley (Cancerslug) in 2002. Soon after, Paths of Possession was approached by Keith Suchland better known as "Splattergod" about releasing their next CD. It was mutually decided that they and Dark Faith would release a split EP, with each band contributing four songs.

While working on the split, Butman was asked to join Withered Earth in late 2002, officially doing so in January 2003, resulting in the band going on hiatus and the split being put on hold. Following the release of Withered Earths' Of Which They Bleed, the band broke up and Butman returned to Tampa and set about resurrecting the dormant Paths of Possession.

As their then vocalist, Bill(Lander), had relocated to New York, Butman asked his friend, George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher (vocalist of Cannibal Corpse) to take over the vocal position. The new line-up then opted to record their six songs in Ozone Studios, St. Petersburg, Florida, finishing in September 2003. The result was entitled The Crypt of Madness and released on Splattergod Records, limited to 1000 copies. Plans were then made between the band and Splattergod to release their full length CD in late 2004 / early 2005.
