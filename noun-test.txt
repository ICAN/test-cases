1// The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

 To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.

2// Heart of Darkness - John Crowther

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen_NN with a plain face, on the throne of   England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the   throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.

4// Perceptual similarity of visual patterns predicts the similarity of their dynamic neural activation patterns measured with MEG - Susan G. Wardle, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi and Thomas A. Carlson  

The 1) aim/NN of the present 2) study/NN is to determine the 3) extent/NN to which perceptual 4) similarity/NN is accessible in dynamic large-scale 5) brain/NN 6) activation/NN 7) patterns/NNS. 8) We/PRP use two methodological 9) advances/NNS to build on previous 10) work/NN: firstly, 11) we/PRP use a novel 12) stimulus/NN set to decouple perceived 13) similarity/NN from both 14) semantics/NNS and lower-level visual 15) features/NNS, and secondly, 16) we/PRP exploit the fine temporal 17) resolution/NN of 18) MEG/NNP to examine the evolving representational 19) geometry/NN across 20) time/NN. To control for low-level 21) features/NNS and 22) semantics/NNS in the visual 23) stimuli/NN, 24) we/PRP constructed visual 25) patterns/NNS from 26) arrangements/NNS of 27) Gabor/NNP 28) patches/NNS, which will drive the 29) response/NN of 30) neurons/NNS in early visual 31) cortex/NN, and make straightforward 32) predictions/NNS for a range of 33) models/NNS that can be used to characterize the evoked cortical 34) response/NN to the 35) stimuli/NN. 

The aim of the present study is to determine the extent to which perceptual similarity is accessible in dynamic large-scale brain activation patterns. We use two methodological advances to build on previous work: firstly, we use a novel stimulus set to decouple perceived similarity from both semantics and lower-level visual features, and secondly, we exploit the fine temporal resolution of MEG to examine the evolving representational geometry across time. To control for low-level features and semantics in the visual stimuli, we constructed visual patterns from arrangements of Gabor patches, which will drive the response of neurons in early visual cortex, and make straightforward predictions for a range of models that can be used to characterize the evoked cortical response to the stimuli. 

5// Search Strategies for Binary Feature Selection for a Naive Bayes Classifier - Tsiziro Rabenero, Jérome Lacaille, Marie Cottrell, and Frabrice Rossi

The 1) goal/NN is to build an interpretable 2) classifier/NN from this 3) knowledge/NN (and from a learning 4) set/NN). Then the 5) scores/NNS are assumed to be simple parametric 6) functions/NNS from the 7) data/NN 8) space/NN to 9) R/NNP with the 10) interpretation/NN that a high 11) value/NN of a 12) score/NN indicates that the 13) datum/NN submitted to the 14) score/NN belongs probably to the 15) class/NN that the 16) score/NN has been designed to detect. Let’s consider a concrete 17) example/NN from our main 18) application/NN 19) domain/NN, 20) aircraft/NN 21) engine/NN 22) monitoring/NN (see [7] for 23) details/NNS). 24) We/PRP aim here at classifying some short 25) time/NN 26) series /NNS (around 150 time 27) points/NNS, each 28) series/NNS having its own specific 29) length/NN) into different 30) classes/NNS (normal 31) signal/NN and different 32) types /NNS of 33) anomalies/NNS corresponding to some non 34) stationarity/NN in the 35) signal/NN). 36) Domain/NN 37) experts/NNS have selected a 38) set/NN of statistical 39) tests/NNS as 40) scores/NNS . For instance, the 41) Mann-Whitney/NNP 42) U/NNP 43) test/NN can be used to reject the null 44) hypothesis/NN that two 45) populations/NNS are identical. 46) It/PRP can be applied to a 47) time/NN 48) series/NN by selecting a potential break 49) point/NN in the 50) series/NN 51) tb/NNP and a 52) window/NN 53) size/NN 54) w/NNP, and by considering the w/2 55) points/NNS before 56) tb/NNP as the first 57) population/NN and the w/2 58) points/NNS after 59) tb/NNP as the second 60) population/NN. 

The goal is to build an interpretable classifier from this knowledge (and from a learning set). Then the scores are assumed to be simple parametric functions from the data space to R with the interpretation that a high value of a score indicates that the datum submitted to the score belongs probably to the class that the score has been designed to detect. Let’s consider a concrete example from our main application domain, aircraft engine monitoring (see [7] for details). We aim here at classifying some short time series (around 150 time points, each series having its own specific length) into different classes (normal signal and different types of anomalies corresponding to some non stationarity in the signal). Domain experts have selected a set of statistical tests as scores. For instance, the Mann-Whitney U test can be used to reject the null hypothesis that two populations are identical. It can be applied to a time series by selecting a potential break point in the series tb and a window size w, and by considering the w/2 points before tb as the first population and the w/2 points after tb as the second population.

Dr._NNP Ben_NNP Carson_NNP blasted Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP for  "deceit_NN and  dirty  tricks_NNS and  lies."_NN
Cruz_NNP just  lied again-  I_PRP am, P and  have P been totally  against  #ObamaCare-  repeal_NN and  replace!_NN
The  State_NNP of  Iowa_NNP should  disqualify  Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP from  the  most S recent  election_NN on  the  basis_NN that  he_PRP cheated-_, a  total  fraud!_NN

Based on  the  fraud_NN committed by  Senator_NNP Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP during  the  Iowa_NNP Caucus,_NNP either  a  new  election_NN should  take  place_NN or  Cruz_NNP results_NNS nullified._.
This  was sent out_RP from  Ted_NNP Cruz-_NNP as  Iowans_NNP arrived at  their_PRP$ caucus_NN sites_NNS to_TO vote.  #CruzFraud_NN
And  finally,  Cruz_NNP strongly  told thousands_NNS of  caucusgoers_NNS (voters)  that  Trump_NNP was strongly  in  favor_NN of  ObamaCare_NNP and  "choice"_NNP -_: a  total_NN lie!_NN
The  Voter_NN Violation_NNP certificate_NN gave poor  marks_NNS to_TO the  unsuspecting  voter(grade_NN of  F)_NNP and  told them_PRP to_TO clear  it_PRP up_RP by  voting for  Cruz._NNP Fraud_NNP
Many  people_NNS voted for  Cruz_NNP over  Carson_NNP because  of  this  Cruz_NNP fraud._NN Also,  Cruz_NNP sent out_RP a  VOTER_NN VIOLATION_NN certificate_NN to_TO thousands_NNS of  voters. G
During  primetime_NN of  the  Iowa_NNP Caucus,_NNP Cruz_NNP put out_RP a  release_NN that  @RealBenCarson_NNP was quitting the  race,_NN and  to_TO caucus  (or  vote)_NN for  Cruz._NNP
Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP didn't_NN win P Iowa,  he_PRP stole it.  That  is why  all  of  the  polls_NNS were so  wrong  and  why  he_PRP got far  more R votes_NNS than  anticipated. Bad!_.
