1// The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

 To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.

2// Heart of Darkness - John Crowther

Between 1) us/PRP there was, as I have already said somewhere, the 2) bond/NN of the sea. Besides holding our 3) hearts/NNS together through long periods of 4) separation/NN, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even 5) convictions/NNS. The 6) Lawyer/NNP--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on 7) deck/NN, and was lying on the only rug. The 8) Accountant/NNP had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the 9) mizzen-mast/NN. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic 10) aspect/NN, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The 11) director/NN, satisfied the anchor had good 12) hold/NN, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was 13) silence/NN on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for 14) nothing/NN but placid staring. The 15) day/NN was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite 16) brilliance/NN. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign 17) immensity/NN of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded 18) rises/NNS inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous 19) folds/NNS. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper 20) reaches/NNS, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the 21) approach/NN of the sun.
There   were   a   22) king_NN with   a   large   23) jaw_NN and   a  24)  queen_NN with   a   plain   25) face,_NN on   the   26) throne_NN of   England;_27) NNP there   were   a   king_NN with   a   large   jaw_NN and   a   queen_NN with   a   fair   face,_NN on   the   throne_NN of   France._NNP In   both   countries_NNS it_PRP was   clearer  R than   crystal_NN to   the   lords_NNS of   the   State_NNP preserves_NNS of   loaves_NNS and   fishes,_NN that   things_NNS in   general   were   settled   for   ever._NN

3// A Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens

It was the best of times, it was the worst of 1) times/NNS, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of 2) foolishness/NN, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of 3) incredulity/NN, it was the season of Light, it was the season of 4) Darkness/NN, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of 5) despair/NN, we had 6) everything/NN before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other 7) way/NN-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for 8) good/NN or for 9) evil/NN, in the superlative degree of 10) comparison/NN only.

4// Perceptual similarity of visual patterns predicts the similarity of their dynamic neural activation patterns measured with MEG - Susan G. Wardle, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi and Thomas A. Carlson  

The aim of the present 1) study/NN is to determine the extent to which perceptual 2) similarity/NN is accessible in dynamic large-scale brain 3) activation/NN patterns. We use two methodological 4) advances/NNS to build on previous 5) work/NN: firstly, we use a novel stimulus set to decouple perceived similarity from both semantics and lower-level visual 6) features/NNS, and secondly, we exploit the fine temporal resolution of 7) MEG/NNP to examine the evolving representational geometry across time. To control for low-level features and 8) semantics/NNS in the visual stimuli, we constructed visual patterns from 9) arrangements/NNS of 10) Gabor/NNP patches, which will drive the 11) response/NN of neurons in early visual cortex, and make straightforward predictions for a range of models that can be used to characterize the evoked cortical response to the stimuli. 
The     12) aim_NN of     the     present     13) study_NN is    Z to     determine     the     14) extent_NN to     which      perceptual     15) similarity_NN is    Z accessible     in     dynamic     large-scale     16) brain_NN 17) activation_NN patterns.

5// Search Strategies for Binary Feature Selection for a Naive Bayes Classifier - Tsiziro Rabenero, Jérome Lacaille, Marie Cottrell, and Frabrice Rossi

The goal is to build an interpretable 1) classifier/NN from this knowledge (and from a 2) learning/NN set). Then the scores are assumed to be simple parametric 3) functions/NNS from the data 4) space/NN to R with the 5) interpretation/NN that a high value of a score indicates that the datum submitted to the score belongs probably to the class that the 6) score/NN has been designed to detect. Let’s consider a concrete example from our main 7) application/NN domain, aircraft engine 8) monitoring/NN (see [7] for details). We aim here at classifying some short time series (around 150 time 9) points/NNS, each series having its own specific length) into different classes (normal signal and different types of 10) anomalies/NNS corresponding to some non 11) stationarity/NN in the signal). Domain experts have selected a set of statistical tests as scores. For instance, the 12) Mann-Whitney/NNP 13) U/NNP test can be used to reject the null hypothesis that two populations are identical. It can be applied to a time series by selecting a potential break point in the 14) series/NNS tb and a window size w, and by considering the w/2 points before tb as the first population and the w/2 points after tb as the second population.

Dr._NNP Ben_NNP Carson_NNP blasted Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP for  "deceit_NN and  dirty  tricks_NNS and  lies."_NN
Cruz_NNP just  lied again-  I_PRP am, P and  have P been totally  against  #ObamaCare-  repeal_NN and  replace!_NN
The  State_NNP of  Iowa_NNP should  disqualify  Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP from  the  most S recent  election_NN on  the  basis_NN that  he_PRP cheated-_, a  total  fraud!_NN

Based on  the  fraud_NN committed by  Senator_NNP Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP during  the  Iowa_NNP Caucus,_NNP either  a  new  election_NN should  take  place_NN or  Cruz_NNP results_NNS nullified._.
This  was sent out_RP from  Ted_NNP Cruz-_NNP as  Iowans_NNP arrived at  their_PRP$ caucus_NN sites_NNS to_TO vote.  #CruzFraud_NN
And  finally,  Cruz_NNP strongly  told thousands_NNS of  caucusgoers_NNS (voters)  that  Trump_NNP was strongly  in  favor_NN of  ObamaCare_NNP and  "choice"_NNP -_: a  total_NN lie!_NN
The  Voter_NN Violation_NNP certificate_NN gave poor  marks_NNS to_TO the  unsuspecting  voter(grade_NN of  F)_NNP and  told them_PRP to_TO clear  it_PRP up_RP by  voting for  Cruz._NNP Fraud_NNP
Many  people_NNS voted for  Cruz_NNP over  Carson_NNP because  of  this  Cruz_NNP fraud._NN Also,  Cruz_NNP sent out_RP a  VOTER_NN VIOLATION_NN certificate_NN to_TO thousands_NNS of  voters. G
During  primetime_NN of  the  Iowa_NNP Caucus,_NNP Cruz_NNP put out_RP a  release_NN that  @RealBenCarson_NNP was quitting the  race,_NN and  to_TO caucus  (or  vote)_NN for  Cruz._NNP
Ted_NNP Cruz_NNP didn't_NN win P Iowa,  he_PRP stole it.  That  is why  all  of  the  polls_NNS were so  wrong  and  why  he_PRP got far  more R votes_NNS than  anticipated. Bad!_.

"@stephbewitching_NN @realDonaldTrump_NN All  you_PRP haters_NNS need  to_TO realize  Trump_NNP got the  second  highest S vote_NN in  history._PRP$ And  he's_PRP$ never  held office!"_NN
