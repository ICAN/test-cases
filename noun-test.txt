1// The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

 To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.

2// Heart of Darkness - John Crowther

Between 1) us/PRP there was, as I have already said somewhere, the 2) bond/NN of the sea. Besides holding our 3) hearts/NNS together through long periods of 4) separation/NN, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even 5) convictions/NNS. The 6) Lawyer/NNP--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on 7) deck/NN, and was lying on the only rug. The 8) Accountant/NNP had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the 9) mizzen-mast/NN. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic 10) aspect/NN, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The 11) director/NN, satisfied the anchor had good 12) hold/NN, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was 13) silence/NN on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for 14) nothing/NN but placid staring. The 15) day/NN was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite 16) brilliance/NN. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign 17) immensity/NN of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded 18) rises/NNS inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous 19) folds/NNS. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper 20) reaches/NNS, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the 21) approach/NN of the sun.

3// A Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens

It was the best of times, it was the worst of 1) times/NNS, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of 2) foolishness/NN, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of 3) incredulity/NN, it was the season of Light, it was the season of 4) Darkness/NN, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of 5) despair/NN, we had 6) everything/NN before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other 7) way/NN-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for 8) good/NN or for 9) evil/NN, in the superlative degree of 10) comparison/NN only.

4// Perceptual similarity of visual patterns predicts the similarity of their dynamic neural activation patterns measured with MEG - Susan G. Wardle, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi and Thomas A. Carlson  

The aim of the present 1) study/NN is to determine the extent to which perceptual 2) similarity/NN is accessible in dynamic large-scale brain 3) activation/NN patterns. We use two methodological 4) advances/NNS to build on previous 5) work/NN: firstly, we use a novel stimulus set to decouple perceived similarity from both semantics and lower-level visual 6) features/NNS, and secondly, we exploit the fine temporal resolution of 7) MEG/NNP to examine the evolving representational geometry across time. To control for low-level features and 8) semantics/NNS in the visual stimuli, we constructed visual patterns from 9) arrangements/NNS of 10) Gabor/NNP patches, which will drive the 11) response/NN of neurons in early visual cortex, and make straightforward predictions for a range of models that can be used to characterize the evoked cortical response to the stimuli. 
The     12) aim_NN of     the     present     13) study_NN is    Z to     determine     the     14) extent_NN to     which      perceptual     15) similarity_NN is    Z accessible     in     dynamic     large-scale     16) brain_NN 17) activation_NN patterns.

5// Search Strategies for Binary Feature Selection for a Naive Bayes Classifier - Tsiziro Rabenero, Jérome Lacaille, Marie Cottrell, and Frabrice Rossi

The goal is to build an interpretable 1) classifier/NN from this knowledge (and from a 2) learning/NN set). Then the scores are assumed to be simple parametric 3) functions/NNS from the data 4) space/NN to R with the 5) interpretation/NN that a high value of a score indicates that the datum submitted to the score belongs probably to the class that the 6) score/NN has been designed to detect. Let’s consider a concrete example from our main 7) application/NN domain, aircraft engine 8) monitoring/NN (see [7] for details). We aim here at classifying some short time series (around 150 time 9) points/NNS, each series having its own specific length) into different classes (normal signal and different types of 10) anomalies/NNS corresponding to some non 11) stationarity/NN in the signal). Domain experts have selected a set of statistical tests as scores. For instance, the 12) Mann-Whitney/NNP 13) U/NNP test can be used to reject the null hypothesis that two populations are identical. It can be applied to a time series by selecting a potential break point in the 14) series/NNS tb and a window size w, and by considering the w/2 points before tb as the first population and the w/2 points after tb as the second population.
