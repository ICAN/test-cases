To 1) Sherlock/NNP Holmes she is always THE 2) woman/NN. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other 3) name/NN. In his 4) eyes/NNS she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any 5) emotion/NN akin to love for Irene 6) Adler/NNP. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced 7) mind/NN. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a 8) lover/NN he would have placed himself in a false 9) position/NN. He never spoke of the softer 10) passions/NNS, save with a gibe and a 11) sneer/NN. They were admirable things for the 12) observer/NN--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and 13) actions/NNS. But for the trained 14) reasoner/NN to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a 15) doubt/NN upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a 16) nature/NN such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

Between 1) us/PRP there was, as I have already said somewhere, the 2) bond/NN of the sea. Besides holding our 3) hearts/NNS together through long periods of 4) separation/NN, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even 5) convictions/NNS. The 6) Lawyer/NNP--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on 7) deck/NN, and was lying on the only rug. The 8) Accountant/NNP had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the 9) mizzen-mast/NN. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic 10) aspect/NN, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The 11) director/NN, satisfied the anchor had good 12) hold/NN, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was 13) silence/NN on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for 14) nothing/NN but placid staring. The 15) day/NN was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite 16) brilliance/NN. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign 17) immensity/NN of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded 18) rises/NNS inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous 19) folds/NNS. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper 20) reaches/NNS, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the 21) approach/NN of the sun.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of 1) times/NNS, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of 2) foolishness/NN, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of 3) incredulity/NN, it was the season of Light, it was the season of 4) Darkness/NN, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of 5) despair/NN, we had 6) everything/NN before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other 7) way/NN-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for 8) good/NN or for 9) evil/NN, in the superlative degree of 10) comparison/NN only.

The aim of the present 1) study/NN is to determine the extent to which perceptual 2) similarity/NN is accessible in dynamic large-scale brain 3) activation/NN patterns. We use two methodological 4) advances/NNS to build on previous 5) work/NN: firstly, we use a novel stimulus set to decouple perceived similarity from both semantics and lower-level visual 6) features/NNS, and secondly, we exploit the fine temporal resolution of 7) MEG/NNP to examine the evolving representational geometry across time. To control for low-level features and 8) semantics/NNS in the visual stimuli, we constructed visual patterns from 9) arrangements/NNS of 10) Gabor/NNP patches, which will drive the 11) response/NN of neurons in early visual cortex, and make straightforward predictions for a range of models that can be used to characterize the evoked cortical response to the stimuli.

The goal is to build an interpretable 1) classifier/NN from this knowledge (and from a 2) learning/NN set). Then the scores are assumed to be simple parametric 3) functions/NNS from the data 4) space/NN to R with the 5) interpretation/NN that a high value of a score indicates that the datum submitted to the score belongs probably to the class that the 6) score/NN has been designed to detect. Let’s consider a concrete example from our main 7) application/NN domain, aircraft engine 8) monitoring/NN (see [7] for details). We aim here at classifying some short time series (around 150 time 9) points/NNS, each series having its own specific length) into different classes (normal signal and different types of 10) anomalies/NNS corresponding to some non 11) stationarity/NN in the signal). Domain experts have selected a set of statistical tests as scores. For instance, the 12) Mann-Whitney/NNP 13) U/NNP test can be used to reject the null hypothesis that two populations are identical. It can be applied to a time series by selecting a potential break point in the 14) series/NNS tb and a window size w, and by considering the w/2 points before tb as the first population and the w/2 points after tb as the second population.
