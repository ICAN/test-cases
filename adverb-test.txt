1//  CHAPTER  1:  INTRODUCTION  Organization  of  the  Thesis  This  thesis  is  organized to  take  the  reader  on  an  academic  journey,  starting  with  literature  on  gender,  race  and  class  and  physics  education  and  leading  to  my   methods,  data,  analysis,  and  findings.  Chapter  1  presents  the  lack  of  diversity  in  physics  education,  where  the  1)most_RBS successful  physics  students  are P middle  class  white  males.  Chapter  2  examines  previous  research  on  gender  and  physics  education,  ending  with  third-wave  feminist  studies  that  take P into  account  the  intersection  of  gender  with  race  and  class. These  studies  suggest P that  when  students’  subjectivities  align  with  the  presentation  of  physics  they  are P 2)more_RBR likely  to  take-up  a  positive  physics  identity,  but  traditional  and  reformed  physics  courses  may  present  physics  3)singularly_RB as  abstract,  elite,  and  rational.  Following  from  the  notion  that  the  culture  of  physics  is  associated with  middle  class  white  masculinity,  in  Chapter  3  I  theorize P a  feminist  physics  education  that  incorporates  ways  of  knowing  associated with  femininity  into  a  reformed  physics  curriculum  called Modeling.  While  reformed  physics  education  has  increased students’  achievement  overall,  feminist  physics  education  seeks  to  build  on  the  benefits  of  that  reform  while  working  to  close  gender,  race  and  class  gaps. In  Chapter  4  I  present P an  ethnographic  methodology  to  learn  how  students’  negotiate P their   subjectivities  to  align  with  or  disengage  from  physics,  and  what  classroom  experiences  work P to  widen  and  close  gaps.  Chapters  5  through  9  present  results  of  the  study.  Chapter  5  highlights  both  stereotypical  and  atypical  ways  that  students  aligned with  or  rejected physics  based on  their   gender,  race  and  class  subjectivities.  In  Chapters  6  and  7  I  analyzed classroom  discourse  and  physics  curriculum  to  identify  ways  that  contribute P to  differences  in  achievement,  participation  and  feelings  towards  physics.  In  Chapters  8  and  9  I  show P how  students  4)took-up_RB other  ways  of  doing  physics  to  form  positive  physics  identities. 2  Chapter  10,  the  concluding  chapter,  discusses  reflections, P implications, and  suggestions  for  future  research  on  supporting  underrepresented  students  in  physics  education._, Why  Are P Most S Physicists  in  the  U.S.  White  Men?  The  representation  of  females  in  physics  is  among  the  lowest S of  the  science  disciplines;  in  the  U.S.  in  2010,  21%  of  bachelors  degrees  were awarded to  women  (AIP,  2012).  While  20%  of  PhDs  in  physics  are P earned by  women,  6)only_RB 8%  of  full  professors  are P female  (AIP,  2013). The  5)most_RBS significant  drop  in  females  occurs  between  high  school  and  college  (Hazari,  Tai,  &  Sadler,  2007). After  completing  one  physics  course,  females  are P 7)less_RBR likely  than  males  to  take  a  second  or  an  AP  physics  course  (National  Science  Board,  2006). P While  the  physics  pipeline  is  leaky  for  all  students,  qualified women  drop  out  of  physics  at  higher R rates  than  qualified men  (National  Research  Council,  1991). A  similar  situation  exists  for  students  of  color.  In  the  US  in  2010,  2.5%  of  physics  bachelors  degrees  were awarded to  African  Americans S and  4%  to  Hispanic  Americans S (AIP,  2012)._`` I  was unable  to  find  statistics  for  the  percentage  of  Black  and  Latino  females  in  physics,  which  suggests  their   small  number  and  the  problematic  tendency  to  think  of  race  and  gender  separately._RP In  2011,  student  enrollment  in  AP  Physics  B  was 4.7%  black  and  35%  female.  In  the  8)more_RBR advanced  course  AP  Physics  C  Mechanics,  2.8%  of  students  were black  and  26%  were female  (College  Board,  2011). Some  of  these  statics  are P due  to  the  intersection  of  race  with  class.  Some  low-income  students  do P 9)not_RB have  access  to  physics  courses._, In  the  Bronx,  the  poorest S and  least S white  borough  of  New  York  City,  10)only_RB 30%  of  public  high  schools  offer P physics  (Kelly &  Sheppard,  2009). These  participation  statistics  mirror P gender,  race  and  class  achievement  gaps. In  2009,  the  National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  reported the  following  data  for  science  enrollments:  (a)  females  scored lower R than  males;  (b)  Black,  Latino,  and  Native  American  3  students  scored lower R than  white  students;  and  (c)  public  school,  urban,  and  free  or  reduced lunch  students  scored lower R than  11)more_RBR affluent  students  (NCES, P 2011).  These  statistics  show P that  physics  education  opportunities  are P a  gender,  race  and  class  issue,  but  they  do P 12)not_RB explain  why  these  gaps  occur. In  this  study  I  focus P on  gender  with  consideration  of  race,  class  and  other  subjectivities  that  impact  students’  experiences  in  physics  education.  A  majority  of  physicists  are P 13)not_RB 14)just_RB men,_, but  white  men  from  middle  class  backgrounds._, The  intersection  of  these  categories  is  fundamental  because  one’s  experience  and  enactment  of  gender  depends  on  her  or  his   race  and  class. My   review  of  literature  starts  with  the  dimension  of  gender  and  leads  to  postmodern  and  third-wave  feminist  research  that  takes  into  account  multiple  subjectivities.  I  chose to  focus  on  gender  because  unlike  biology  and  chemistry,  physics  has  15)not_RB had the  same  degree  of  increase  in  female  participation  over  the  past  fifty  years  (AIP,  2012).   I  am P curious  to  know  what  makes  physics  different,  and  what  can  be  done about  it.  From  a  gender  lens,  Hazari  &  Potvin  (2005) examine  three  common  explanations  for  the  lack  of  women  in  physics:  1)  biological  differences  between  male  and  female,  2)  socialized  differences  between  male  and  female,  and  3)  cultural  bias  of  physics.  The  first  explanation  is  rooted in  the  belief  that  gender  difference  in  ability  and  interest  is  innate.  For  example,  in  2005  the  president  of  Harvard  University  suggested that  biological  differences  in  science  and  math  aptitudes  might  explain  the  gender  gap, though  scholars  critique  brain  research  used to  establish  difference  in  16)socially_RB constructed categories  (Jordan-Young,_: 2010)._RP In  addition,  students’  own  belief  that  their   gender  determines  their   cognitive  ability  results  in  a  self-fulfilling  prophecy.  Stereotype  threat,_, or  the  idea  that  women  are P 17)not_RB 18)as_RB good  at  physics  as  men,  causes  female  students  to  perform  below  males  (Dar-Nimrod  &  Heine,  2006). The  second  explanation  is  that  4  gender  differences  are P acquired as  a  result  of  socialization.  Children  learn P gender  (and  race  and  class)  performance  by  watching  and  participating  in  the  social  world.  They  interact  with  men  and  women  in  their   lives,  watch  men  and  women  on  TV,  and  are P disciplined by  individuals  and  institutions  to  be  boys  or  girls._'' This  viewpoint  might  explain  why  in  a  survey  of  437  sixth-grade  students,  boys  had 19)more_RBR experience  with  tools,  electronics,  and  simple  machines,  while  girls  had 20)more_RBR experience  knitting,  cooking,  and  gardening  (Jones,  Howe,  &  Rua,  2000)._'' This  argument  suggests  that  girls  are P 21)not_RB 22)biologically_RB determined to  be  creative, caring,  and  charming,  but  they  are P disciplined as  females  to  adopt  these  characteristics.  The  third  explanation  of  gender  gaps  in  physics  is  that  the  field  of  physics  is  23)culturally_RB biased. For  example,  in  the  American  Institute  of  Physics  report  Women  Physicists  Speak  24)Again_RB (Ivie  &  Guo,  2006), a  majority  of  female  physicists  were discouraged about  physics.  They  referenced negative  interactions  with  colleagues  and  provided stories  of  discriminatory  attitudes.  Eighty  percent  of  respondents  said attitudes  about  women  in  science  needed improvement.  While  these  female  physicists  persisted in  physics,  I  seek P to  understand  what  happens  in  physics  education  that  might  cause  women  to  leave.  25)Yet,_RB invoking  the  category  “women”  assumes  such  a  defined group  of  human  beings  exists. P It  suggests  that  “women”  share  commonalities,  which  are P different  from  “men.”  26)Yet,_RB 27)not_RB all  human  beings  are P one  way  or  the  other.  Babies  born intersex  


2// !The!conatus!doctrine  The  other  a1priori,  attribute  neutral  principle  that  is  central  to  Spinoza’s  account  of  finite  things  is  the  conatus  doctrine.  Section  1  established that  God  does  1)not_RB 2)just_RB cause  the  existence  of  things,  but  3)also_RB determines  them  to  produce  certain  effects:  A  thing  which  has  been determined to  produce  an  effect  has  4)necessarily_RB been determined in  this  way  by  God;  and  one  which  has  5)not_RB been determined by  God  cannot  determine  itself  to  produce  an  effect  (Ip26  ._. 6)Perhaps_RB Spinoza’s_. 7)most_RBS explicit  statement  of  the  relation  between  a  thing  and  its   effects  is  at  IIIp7,  which  establishes  that  the  striving  or  endeavor  (conatus  of  a  thing  to  “persevere  in  its   being  (esse  ”  is  “nothing  but  the  actual  essence  of  the  thing.”  8)Very_RB 9)often_RB this  is  taken to  show  that  a  thing’s  endeavor  toward  selfYpreservation  is  identical  with  the  essence  of  the  thing.  But  it’s  questionable,  10)first,_RB that  IIIp7  asserts  an  identity  and  second,  that  the  “conatus”  11)only_RB refers  to  a  thing’s  endeavor  toward  selfYpreservation.  I’ll  deal  with  each  of  these  in  turn.  The  wording  of  IIIp7  demands  comparison  with  Descartes’  12)first_RB law: 13)First_RB law:  each  and  every  thing 14) insofar_RB as  it  s  simple  and  undivided  15)always_RB remains  in  the  same  state  16)as_RB 17)far_RB as  it  can  (quantum1in1se1est  ,_, nor  does  it  18)ever_RB change  except  by  external  causes.  19)Thus,_RB if  a  particular  part  of  matter  is  square, we  can  be  sure  without  more R ado  that  it  will  remain  square  forever,  unless  something  coming  from  outside  changes  its   shape.  If  it  is  at  rest,  we  hold P that  it  will  20)never_RB begin  to  move  unless  it  is  pushed into  motion  by  some  cause.  And  if  it  moves,_, there_EX is  21)equally_RB no  reason  for  thinking  that  it  will  22)ever_RB cease  this  motion  of  its   own  accord  and  without  61  being  checked by  something  23)else._RB 24)Hence_RB we  must  conclude  that  whatever  moves,  so_RB far_RB as  it  can,  25)always_RB moves. R The  language  of  IIIp4Y6  –  that  a  thing  perseveres  “insofar_RB as  it  is  in  itself  (quantum1in1se1  est  ”  –  mirrors  the  language  of  discussions  of  the  principle  of  inertia,  not_RB only_RB in  Descartes  but  in  Lucretius  and  many  others.  57  So  although  Garrett  and  Della  Rocca,  for  example,  see P in  this  language  an  indication  that  Spinoza  believes  that  finite  things  can  be  at  least S 26)partially_RB “in_RB themselves”_, as  substances  are, P such  an  explanation  is  undermotivated 27)insofar_RB as  this  language  and  the  related  concept  of  “striving”  has  solid  

3// THE  BIG  IDEA:_.
—  Terrorism  has  emerged as  the  top  concern  among  Republican  primary  voters,  and  Donald  Trump  is  seen as  the  candidate  1)best_RB equipped to  combat  it.  This  is  the  main  reason  Trump  has  popped in  the  polls  since  his   call  last  week  for  a  temporary  ban  on  Muslim  immigration  into  the  United  States. 
A  fresh  Washington  Post-ABC  News  poll  finds  that  38  percent  of  Republicans S name  terrorism  as  the  single  2)most_RBS important  issue,  compared with  29  percent  who  name P the  economy  and 3) just_RB 6  percent  who  highlight  immigration. “Asked to  choose  which  candidate  among  the  top  five  they  would  trust  4)most_RBS to  deal  with  threats  of  terrorism,  half  of  Republicans S cite P Trump,”  Dan  Balz  and  Scott  Clement  write  this  morning. 
Our   poll  finds  Trump  getting  38  percent  among  Republicans S nationally,_, his   highest S mark  yet.  Ted  Cruz  of  Texas  has  surged into  second  with  15  percent,  4)effectively_RB doubling  his   support  since  our   poll  last  month.  Marco  Rubio  and  Ben  Carson  are P tied for  third,  with  12  percent  each. 
Fifty-nine  percent  of  Republicans  agree P with  Trump’s  proposed Muslim  ban,_RB even_RB as  60  percent  of  all  adults  5)nationally_RB say P it  is  the  wrong  thing  to  do._POS
Wolf  Blitzer,  moderating  6)tonight’s_RB debate  on  CNN,  plans  to  focus  7)heavily_RB on  terrorism  and  ISIS.  “We’ll  get  to  other  subjects  as  well,”_RB he  told his   cable  channel,  “but  that’s  going  to  be  a  8)really_RB important  focus,  because  that’s  where  the  American  public  is  right  now.”_RB
Other  surveys  9)also_RB 10)back_RB up  the  sudden  salience  of  terrorism  in  the  wake  of  the  attacks  in  Paris  and  San  Bernardino.  A  Quinnipiac  University  poll  of  Iowa,  which  finds  Trump  and  Cruz  tied (28-27  among  likely  GOP  caucus-goers,_, has  30  percent  naming  terror  as  their   top  issue,  compared to  21  percent  for  the  economy,  13  percent  for  foreign  policy  and  11  percent  for  immigration.  In  Iowa,  asked who  can  best S deal  with  terrorism,  33  percent  of  Republicans S said Trump  to  24  percent  for  Cruz  and  9  percent  for  Rubio. 
Gallup  offers  good  benchmarks  on  how  the  current  level  of  fear  among  voters  compares  to  the  weeks  after  previous  terrorist  attacks:  Their   own  poll,  published yesterday,_RB found that  one  in  six  Americans,  or  16  percent,  12)now_RB identify P terrorism  as  the  11)most_RBS important  U.S.  problem,  11)up_RB from  13)just_RB 3  percent  last  month.  “This  is  the  highest S percentage  of  Americans S to  mention  terrorism  in  a  decade,  although  it  is  14)still_RB lower R than  the  46%  measured after  9/11,”  writes  Rebecca  Riffkin.  “In  2004,  mentions  rose as_RB high  as  19%  after  the  Madrid  train  bombings,  and  then_RB jumped 14)again_RB to  17%  in  2005  after  the  London  train  and  bus  bombings.  Since  2007,  less R than  10%  of  Americans S — P 15)sometimes_RB less R than  1%  —  have P mentioned terrorism  in  Gallup’s  16)monthly_RB updates,  although  mentions  did spike  again_RB to  8%  in  early  2010  after  the  failed ‘underwear  bombing.’” 
[Get  The  Daily  202  delivered 17)directly_RB to  your   email  inbox]_.
Key  data  point  that  underscores  what  Trump  is  tapping  into:“Americans’  trust  in  the  government  to  protect  them  from  terrorism  is  the  lowest S Gallup  has  measured.” N
—  So_RB 18)much_RB for  being  the  flavor  of  the  month:  Tomorrow  is  the  six  month  anniversary  of  Trump  kicking  off_RP his   presidential  campaign. 
One  month  ago,  Jeb  Bush  declared 19)confidently_RB to  a  room  of  anxious  donors  in  Dallas:  “Come  December  15,  Trump  will  be  in  decline.”  Well,  today  is  Dec.  15.  And  The  Post  poll  puts  Jeb  at  5  percent  to  Trump’s  38  percent.  “I’m  super-worried  for  him,”  a  major  donor  who  has  hosted fundraisers  for  the  former  Florida  governor  tells  Ed  O’Keefe. 
—  Close  to  home:  The  chairman  of  the  Prince  William  County  Board  of  Supervisors S will  chair  Trump’s  Virginia  campaign.  Corey  A.  Stewart  spearheaded the  suburban  D.C.  area  county’s  crackdown  on  undocumented  immigrants  a  few  years  ago,  which  he  said led to  turning  over_RP more R than  7,500  people  to  federal  authorities  and  a  significant  drop  in  violent  crime. 
Tellingly,  Stewart  broke with  Trump  on  his   plan  to  stop  Muslims  from  entering  the  country  just_RB hours  after  the  campaign  announced his   role:  “I  have P a  20)very_RB strong  relationship  with  the  Muslim  community  in  Northern  Virginia,”  he  told The  Post’s  Jenna  Portnoy  in  a  phone  interview  last  night.  “I’m  not_RB going  to  agree  with  everything  that  Donald  Trump  says  and  this  is  probably_RB one  of  them.   I  have P a  21)very_RB good  relationship  —  and  it’s 22)not_RB something  I  will  jeopardize.  And  I  hope P to  be  a  bridge  between  Trump  and  the  Muslim  community.” 
—  23)More_RBR Republicans S 24)publicly_RB say P they  won’t back_RB The  Donald:  Rep.Reid  Ribble  (Wis.  told a  local  radio  station  that  he  won’t support  Trump  if  he’s   the  GOP  nominee,  adding:  “I  have P had dozens  of  Republicans  and  also_RB fellow  colleagues  here_RB in  Congress  say P to  me  they  will  not_RB support  Trump  no  matter  what.”  Ribble  said he  wouldn’t  vote  for  Hillary  Clinton  but  25)perhaps_RB for  a  Libertarian  Party  candidate,  per  BuzzFeed.

Stephanie  Hundley  is  an  enthusiastic  Bernie  Sanders  supporter. The  28-year-old  from  Waterloo  is  1)also_RB enthusiastic  about  the  fact  that  she's  2)not_RB going  to  vote  for  Hillary  Clinton  3)just_RB because  she's  a  woman. 
"I  4)don't_RB think P she's  the  woman  to  be  representative  of  women,"  Hundley  said. She  ticked off_RP a  list  of  Clinton  criticisms: the  "damn  emails,"  the  "flip-flops,"  her  vote  to  go  to  war  in  Iraq.  Citing  Sanders'  record  of  supporting  women's  rights,_, Hundley  said his   overall  views  embody P hers  5)more_RBR than  Clinton's  do._, "It's  weird  that  an  old,  white  guy  would  represent  women  better R than  an  actual  woman." 
Many  millennial  women,  like  Hundley,  want P to  deal  a  repeat  upset  to  Clinton  in  the  Hawkeye  State.  Eight  years  ago,  Clinton  lost the  women's  vote  in  Iowa  to  another  candidate  promising  change  in  Washington.  Entrance  polls  showed that  the  only  group  who  favored her  were the  oldest S women  — P those  over  65.  A  similar  pattern  could  emerge  6)again_RB this  year.  Iowa  women  do P prefer  Clinton,  according  to  the  finalDes  Moines  Register  poll  before  the  Iowa  caucuses,_, but  that  support  is  strongest S among  women  over  45. 
The  split  has  exposed a  fault  line  around  feminism  in  America,  between  women  who  grew up_RP in  an  era  when  they  weren't allowed to  wear  pants  to  work,  for  example  —_, and  young  women  who  have P 7)never_RB known the  kind  of  discrimination  and  stereotypes  their   mothers  faced._.

A  January  online  survey  of  young  voters  from  USA  Today  and  Rock  the  Vote  showed that  women  under  35  supported Sanders  by  an  9)almost_RB 20-point  margin,  compared to  men's  4-point  margin.

Katherine  Hillicker  is  a  freshman  at  Michigan  State  who  came down  to  Iowa  to  canvass  for  Sanders.  She  sees  near-universal  support  for  Sanders  among  their   peers  at  Michigan  State,  and  she  thinks  she  knows  why._.
Young  people,  she  said, "have  grown up_RP in  this  situation  where  the  economy  has  been crap, and  we're_RB going  to  college,  and  it's_RB costing  a  ton  of  money."  She  and  her   friend,  fellow  Michigan  State  student  Mackenzie  Pollick,  say P they  think P Sanders  appeals  10)more_RBR to  young  people  on  those  economic  issues. 
As  for  gender?  It  was an  afterthought  for  them.  "I_RB think P you  need P to  care  11)more_RBR about  the  issues  than  the  gender,"  Hillicker  said._.

Some  young  voters  say P it  would  be  nice  to  have  the  first  female  president  —_, but  that's  about  19)as_RB excited as  they  get. 
"We're  20)still_RB young,"_, said Olivia  Vogel,  an  Iowa  State  student,  "and  there's  going  to  be  a  lot  more R elections  in  our   lifetime,  that  right_RB now_RB I  wouldn't  choose  just_RB because  she's  a  woman."

Vogel  attended a  Clinton  rally  in  Ames  on  Saturday,  but  20)isn't_RB supporting  a  candidate  yet._.
"I  feel P like  I  grew up_RP in  a  pretty  equitable  society  where  I  think P men  and  women  are P based fairly,"_RB said Vogel's  friend  Julia  Zappa,  a  sophomore  at  the  University  of  St.  Thomas  in  St.  Paul.  Though  she  was at  the  Clinton  event,  she  said she  supports  Republican  Chris  Christie.  "I  think P for  a  younger R generation,  we  don't P need  to  rush  for  a  woman  to  become  president,  because  I  feel P like  it'll  happen,  so  I  don't_RB want P to  rush." 
The  long  string  of  presidential  elections  21)ahead_RB of  them  is  full  of  the  possibility  —  or  even_RB the  probability,  as  Zappa  sees  it  —  of  a  female  president.  That  means  other  issues  feel P much_RB 22)more_RBR pressing  right_RB now._.
"I  don't  think P voting  for  a  woman  is  particularly_RB novel  for  them,"  said Dianne  Bystrom,  director  of  the  Carrie  Chapman  Catt  Center  for  Women  and  Politics  at  Iowa  State  University.  "The  fact  that  the  nation  elected its   first  African-American  candidate  in  2008,  it's  kind  of  taken the  edge  out  of  those  narrow  parameters  of  who  can  be  president." N
If  that's  true,  the  gender  card  —  which  Clinton  is  playing  more_RBR 23)forcefully_RB this  year  than  in  2008  —  may  be  less R effective  now_RB for  some  young  voters. 
But  their   minds  may  change  as  they  age. 
"I  think P younger R women  will  face  some  discrimination  in  their   lives,  but  when  they're  young,  they  24)probably_RB haven't," P Bystrom  said. Older R women,  meanwhile,_RB "feel P that  it's  about  time  to  have  a  woman  president,"  she  added. 
Of  course,  the  reasons  anyone  supports  Clinton  (or  Sanders)  are P 25)far_RB 26)more_RBR nuanced  than  voting  for  a  gender.  Many  women  — P old  or  young,  supporting  Clinton  or  Sanders  —_, say P that  gender  isn't  a  factor  at  all  in  choosing  a  candidate. 
And  some  Sanders-supporting  women  say P they  considered the  draw  of  caucusing  for  a  woman,  but  it  27)ultimately_RB couldn't  sway  them.  Likewise,  for  many  Clinton  supporters,  who  are P drawn in  by  her   gender,  it's_RB simply_RB one  of  many  reasons. 
However,  it  is  a  reason  that  amps  up  their   enthusiasm. 
"It's  about  time  we  caught up_RP with  the  rest  of  the  civilized  world,"  said Maureen  Ekeland  of  West  Des  Moines,  who  attended a  Clinton  speech  in  Ames  with  her   daughter  and  granddaughter.  All  three  are P Clinton  supporters._.
"It's  don't_RB think P it's  the  only  thing,  and  it  might  not_RB be  the  main  thing._. But  absolutely_RB — it  would  be  an  amazing  thing,"  said Jennifer  Ruggle  of  Waukee,  Ekeland's  daughter._.

Chapter  one  Suppose  that  you  and  I  were sitting G in  a  quiet  room  overlooking  a  gar-1  den,  chatting  and  sipping G at  our   cups S of  green  tea  while  we  talked J P about  something  that  had happened a  long  while  1)ago,_RB and  I  said to  you,  "That  afternoon  when_WRB I  met so-and-so  ._. ._. ._. was the  2)very_RB best S afternoon  of  my   life,  and  3)also_RB the  4)very_RB worst S afternoon."  I  expect P you  might_MD put  down_RP your   teacup  and  say, "Well, P now,_, which  was it? Was it  the  best S or  the  worst?  Because  it  can't_MD 6)possibly_RB have  been both!"  5)Ordinarily_RB I'd P have P to  laugh  at  myself  and  agree  with  you.  But  the  truth  is Z that  the  afternoon  when_WRB I  met Mr. P Tanaka P Ichiro P really_RB was the  best S and  the  worst S of  my   life.  He  seemed 7)so_RB fascinating  to  me,  8)even_RB the  fish  smell  on  his   hands S was a  kind  of  perfume.  If  I  had 9)never_RB known him,  I'm  sure  I  would_MD 10)not_RB have  become a  geisha.  I  wasn't born and  raised to  be  a  Kyoto P geisha.  I  wasn't 11)even_RB born in  Kyoto. P I'm  a  fisherman's  daughter  from  a  little  town  called Yoroido P on  the  Sea P of  Japan. P In  all  my   life  I've  never_RB told more R than  a  handful  of  people S anything  at  all  about  Yoroido, P or  about  the  house  in  which  I  grew up,_RB or  about_RB my   mother  and  father,  or  my   older R sister-and  12)certainly_RB 13)not_RB about  how_WRB I  became a  geisha,  or  what  it  was like  to  be  one.  Most S people S would_MD 13)much_RB 14)rather_RB carry  on_RP with  their   fantasies S that  my   mother  and  grandmother  were geisha,  and  that  I  began my   training  in  dance  when_WRB I  was weaned from  the  breast,  and  so_RB on. P As  a  matter  of  fact,  one  day  many  years S ago  I  was pouring G a  cup  of  sake  for  a  man  who  happened to  mention  that  he  had been in  Yoroido P 15)only_RB the  previous  week.  Well,  I  felt as  a  bird  must_MD feel  when_WRB it  has Z flown across  the  ocean  and  comes Z upon  a  creature  that  knows Z its   nest.  I  was so_RB shocked I  couldn't_MD stop  myself  from  saying: G "Yoroido! P Why, P that's  where_WRB I  grew up!"_RB This  poor  man!  His   face  went through  the  16)most_RBS remarkable  series  of  changes.  He  tried his   best S to  smile,  though  it  didn't come out_RP 17)well_RB because  he  couldn't_MD get  the  look  of  shock  off  his   face.

I  18)long_RB 19)ago_RB developed a  very_RB practiced  smile,  which  I  call P my   "Noh  smile"  because  it  resembles Z a  Noh  mask  whose   features S are P frozen.  Its   advantage  is Z that  men S can_MD interpret  it  however_RB they  want; P you  can_MD imagine  how_WRB often_RB I've P relied on  it.   I  decided I'd_RB better R use  it  just_RB then,_, and  of  course  it  worked._MD He  let  out_RP all  his   breath  and  tossed down_RP the  cup  of  sake  I'd P poured for  him  before  giving G an  enormous  laugh  I'm  sure  was prompted more_RBR by  relief  than  anything  21)else._RB "The  20)very_RB idea!"  he  said, with  another  big  laugh.  "You, S growing G up_RP in  a  dump  like  Yoroido. P That's P like  making G tea  in  a  bucket!"  And  when_WRB he'd  laughed again,  he  said to  me,  "That's P why_WRB you're  so_RB much_RB fun,  Sayuri-san. P Sometimes_RB you  22)almost_RB make P me  believe  your   little  jokes S are P real."_RB I  don't P much_RB like  thinking  of  myself  as  a  cup  of  tea  made in  a  bucket,  but  I  suppose P in  a  way  it  must_MD be  true.  After  all,  I  did grow  up_RP in  Yoroido, P and  no  one  would_MD suggest  it's  a  glamorous  spot.  24)Hardly_RB anyone  23)ever_RB visits Z it.
